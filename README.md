# basicDataStructures
Implemented following Data Structures in Java

1. Trie :- Also called as prefix tree. Used in Dictionaries. Search, insert, delete all having O(n) complexity where n is lenght of word to search/insert.
           Drawback is space. It consumes HUGE space. Thus mostly used as binary Trie.
